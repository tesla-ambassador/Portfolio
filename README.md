## My Portfolio.

> This is my portfolio website.

### What I have to say.

I made it a while ago but then had to make some more changes cause I thought I could do it better... Please feel free to contact me for a job offer or collaboration... My rent is due ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Anyways, it's not as flashy cause I wanted to make it as simple as possible.

### What I learned from this.

Yes, I did indeed learn something from updating this portfolio file... How to use environment variables in nextjs. It was a pain because I'm used to how they work in nodejs. It thought it was the same thing, just require your dotenv and you have your magic ðŸ¤£ lol!
So, embarassing fact: I didn't need to hide those variables... They can be public cause I can have a public key arrggghhhh. Well, at least I learned how to use environment variables in Next.js. A win's a win. Now to update my contact.jsx file.

### What I used.

- I was heavy on that [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs)
- I don't know why I have [nextui](https://www.heroui.com/) in my dependencies cause I don't see their components anywhere ðŸ˜‚
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) ofcourse.
- Who doesn't love [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/docs)

### Other side notes.

So I had to update my nextjs version because the first time I made this site was when we were still using <strong>REACT 18</strong>. It was a pain cause I had to use `npm install --force`.
I also had to move files around the place because I realised I used a very unprofessional file structure in my development environment but all in all, I'm proud I didn't resort to restarting the whole project afresh... I fixed it ðŸ¥¹

### Conclusion.

I'd like to conclude by dedicating this project to my beautiful girlfriend... Belinda Comfort!

> > PS: I know the site has a lot of amber (yellow) going on but that isn't my favorite color... Not even close. It just happened to match the landing hero background so I just went with the flow. ðŸ˜©
